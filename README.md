# Unit 19

## Cryptocurrency Wallet

My name is Oscar Lopez, I’m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Program.

In this activity, I was tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into an application called Fintech Finder. This application will enable customers to find fintech professionals from a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency 

I developed the two existing code files, the fintech finder file is associated with the web interface of the app compatible with the Streamlite library. The crypto wallet file contains the Ethereum functions that will import statements to interface the fintech finder file.

Integrating the two files will allow me to generate a digital wallet, access account balances, signing and sending transactions via the Ethereum blockchain called Ganache. Ganache will allow me to generate a new account by using the mnemonic seed phrase, fetch and display account balances, calculate value of a transaction including gas fees, digitally sign a transaction and send it to the blockchain to pay a candidate, and review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.
